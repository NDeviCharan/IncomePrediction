# IncomePrediction
**Small Project Topic:** Salary segregation using various
ML models:  
I designed a python program to create a classific
ation model to predict the salary (<=50k or >50k)
based on a dataset provided with different professional parameters.  

The project flow was:  

- Adding the coloumn names
- Preprocessing the dataset: replacing null and garbage values with mean or mode of the data.  
- Splitting the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
- Different models from SKLearn like Decision Tree Classifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, SVC were used.  
- Based on the results confusion matrix and classification report were made.
